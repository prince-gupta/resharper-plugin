Rename it to start with **\"rs\"**.\r\n3. Create a file named as sonar-project.properties.\r\n\r\n  ####sonar-project.properties\r\n\r\n    `sonar.projectKey=<key-for-project for sonar-db>`\r\n\r\n    `sonar.projectName=<name-for-project that will display on dashboard>`\r\n\r\n    `sonar.projectVersion=<project-version>`\r\n\r\n    `sonar.sources=<source-directory-path-relative-to-property-file>`\r\n\r\n    `sonar.resharperplugin.reportsPath=<directory-path-having-resharper-xml-relative-to-property-file>/`\r\n\r\n4.
